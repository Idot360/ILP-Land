Optimization target: Happiness (H)

Additional minimization target: Cost (C)

function(F)

measured(M)

Parameters:

Affordability (F) - Income & Cost of living (M)

Population (M)

Land Size (M)

Average work hours (M)

Government style (M)

Government corruption (M)

Environment (F)

Number of buildings (F, target) - total & recreational & Office & Residential & Necessities (M)


General Idea:

Regression fitting the parameters to a function (record variance)

Use basic optimization algorithms to find optimal buildings 

account for variance by using a random matrix with set mean and s.d. (basically a simulation)
